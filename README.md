# GlassCuttingAlgorithms

Code for 2nd module. Aim to write algorithms to fit panes of glass (of different dimensions) onto a sheet in the most efficient manner. 

1) First Fit: For each glass pane, go through all previous sheets looking to find the first place for the pane can fit.
2) Next Fit: For each glass pane, place it on a shelf as quickly as possible. If it cannot fit onto this shelf in any manner then create a new sheet.
